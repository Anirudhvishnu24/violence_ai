# 🚀 PUSH TO GITHUB - STEP-BY-STEP

## Step 1: Pre-Push Verification

Run this to verify files are correct:

```powershell
cd D:\violence_ai
git status
```

**You should see:**
- ✅ Files like: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `app/ui.py`, `src/model_download.py`, etc.
- ❌ NO `model/violence_model.h5`
- ❌ NO `data/` folder
- ❌ NO `venv/` folder

---

## Step 2: Stage Changes

```powershell
cd D:\violence_ai
git add .
```

This stages all changes while respecting `.gitignore` (model file, data, venv are excluded).

---

## Step 3: Review Staged Files

```powershell
git status
```

**Expected output shows only:**
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  modified:   .gitignore
  modified:   README.md
  modified:   app/ui.py
  modified:   requirements.txt
  modified:   src/model_download.py
  modified:   src/predict.py
  [other documentation files]
```

**NOT present:**
- ❌ violence_model.h5
- ❌ data/
- ❌ venv/
- ❌ __pycache__/

---

## Step 4: Commit

```powershell
git commit -m "Configure Google Drive auto-download for trained model (Case 1 deployment)"
```

**Expected output:**
```
[main abc1234] Configure Google Drive auto-download for trained model (Case 1 deployment)
 6 files changed, 120 insertions(+), 15 deletions(-)
```

---

## Step 5: Push to GitHub

```powershell
git push origin main
```

**Expected output:**
```
Enumerating objects: 25, done.
Counting objects: 100% (25/25), done.
Delta compression using up to 16 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (18/18), done.

remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), done.
To https://github.com/Anirudhvishnu24/violence_ai.git
   abc1234..def5678  main -> main
```

---

## Step 6: Verify on GitHub

Open: https://github.com/Anirudhvishnu24/violence_ai

Check:
- ✅ README.md is displayed
- ✅ All source code files present
- ✅ requirements.txt with gdown
- ✅ model/ folder exists (empty)
- ✅ NO violence_model.h5 file
- ✅ NO data/ folder visible
- ✅ Branch is "main"

---

## All Commands at Once (Copy-Paste)

```powershell
cd D:\violence_ai
git add .
git commit -m "Configure Google Drive auto-download for trained model (Case 1 deployment)"
git push origin main
```

---

## What Users Will See

After push, users can:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Anirudhvishnu24/violence_ai.git
cd violence_ai

# Install dependencies (including gdown)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app/ui.py

# First run: Model auto-downloads from Google Drive (~2-3 min)
# Second run: Uses cached model (instant)
# Result: Violence detection app ready to use - NO RETRAINING NEEDED!
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "nothing to commit" | Already pushed - check GitHub |
| "file too large" | Verify `.gitignore` excludes `model/violence_model.h5` |
| "permission denied" | GitHub auth required - browser window will pop up |
| "needs merge" | Run `git pull origin main` then `git push origin main` |

---

## Success Indicators ✓

You'll know it worked when:

1. ✅ `git push` completes with "main -> main"
2. ✅ GitHub repo shows code but NO model file
3. ✅ README displays on GitHub front page
4. ✅ Users can clone and see all files (except model)
5. ✅ Model auto-downloads on first run
